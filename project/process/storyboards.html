        <p>The Art of Collaboration should be fun for kids to participate with,
          both on their own and in groups. I could be a tool that teachers use
          to get kids to document their artwork, or it can be entertainment for
          kids at home. Ultimately, kids should be able to d=come up with
          something they are proud of through using the app: something they want
          to show their friends, teachers, and family.</p>
