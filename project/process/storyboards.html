        <p>The Art of Collaboration should be fun for kids to participate with,
          both on their own and in groups. I could be a tool that teachers use
          to get kids to document their artwork, or it can be entertainment for
          kids at home. Ultimately, kids should be able to come up with
          something they are proud of through using the app: something they want
          to show their friends, teachers, and family.</p>
