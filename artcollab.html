      <h3>What is <em>Art of Collabortion</em>?</h3>
      <p>The Art of Collaboration is an app through which primary and secondary
        school students can share there art ideas and materials, and build
        portfolios. The app has two main parts: one to upload and display
        personal projects, and one to create and share beginnings of projects
        that others can finish.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>The Art of Collaboration app will encourage participation in the arts
          for students who don’t have the opportunity to take art classes in
          school or the funds to take art outside of school. Art is important in
          early education to develop fine motor skills, creativity,
          self-confidence, and non-verbal communication, among other skills. The
          app’s end goal is to help close the education gap by getting young
          students to spark each other’s creative interests.</p>

        <h4>About the Creator</h4>
        <p>Allison Love is a senior design major at UC Davis and has spent the
          last four years trying to take a broad range of classes and learn as
          much as possible. Allison has always been interested in art and
          design, but has had little idea where that would take her. A little
          late in her college career, Allison discovered computer science and
          the world of code. Since then, Allison has been learning as many
          coding skills and languages as she can while finishing her degree in
          design and nurturing her desire to work with kids.</p>
