        <p>The paper prototype user testing gave me a really good idea of how to
          set up and fill out my web app. First, it made it clear how the
          navigation should work. I found out that having a home and back option
          on each page will give the user more control and easier access to the
          website. Second, many holes in my plan came to light. I realized that
          in order to be thorough, I need to add alerts that make sure the user
          is navigating where they want to go, and give new navigation options
          once an action is complete. For example, when a user finishes saving a
          project, they should have the option to keep working on the project,
          or go directly to a different part of the site. Third, I learned that
          some external links might greatly benefit the project. Links to art
          tutorials might help round out the web app and give students a little
          more information to work with. It also might be helpful to include a
          short video on how to navigate and interact with the site.</p>
