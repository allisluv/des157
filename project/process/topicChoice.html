        <p>An Art Sharing Site</p>
        <p>Arts are majorly under-funded in many public schools, despite that
          involvement in arts is proven to enhance education. This site would
          help students (elementary to high school) build portfolios and get
          inspiration from other students. It would also be a platform for
          sharing ideas and materials.</p>
