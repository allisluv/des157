        <p>Abstract</p>
        <p>The Art of Collaboration is an app through which primary and
          secondary school students can share there art ideas and materials, and
          build portfolios. The app has two main parts: one to upload and
          display personal projects, and one to create and share beginnings of
          projects that others can finish.</p>
        <p>The Art of Collaboration app will encourage participation in the arts
          for students who don’t have the opportunity to take art classes in
          school or the funds to take art outside of school. Art is important in
          early education to develop fine motor skills, creativity,
          self-confidence, and non-verbal communication, among other skills. The
          app’s end goal is to help close the education gap by getting young
          students to spark each other’s creative interests.</p>

        <p>Description</p>
        <p>On the Art of Collaboration app, students as young as six or seven
          and as old as 18 can intuitively do and share art. The app is designed
          to work mainly on tablets, which is a technology that young kids find
          easiest to navigate. It is also a functional website for computers.
          The app allows for students to draw in the app itself, and also stores
          files in a printable format so that projects can be started or finished
          as a physical copy. In other words, one student may draw a black and
          white image of a bird digitally on the app, and another student may
          print out that image and color it in.</p>
        <p>The app also makes it easy to upload or take pictures of art that
          students have created through the app, or separately. The app will
          prompt the user to input key information like the artists’ name/s, the
          date it was produced, a title, and an optional short description to
          teach the basics of what should be included with an image in a
          portfolio. Students will be able to look through each other’s work to
          find inspiration and think about what others see when they walk
          through the world.</p>
        <p>This project connects to the ISEA theme of peace and the “Design,
          Art, Science, and Technology” sub-theme because it intends to involve
          a young audience in the arts and encourage sharing and collaboration
          among students.</p>
