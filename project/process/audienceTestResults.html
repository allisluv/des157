        <p>Audence testing was very enlightening and encouraging. It ws great to
          see members of my target audience interacting with a prototype, and it
          gave me the impression that I am on the right track with this project.
          After three users tested my Prototype 3, I have some ideas for both
          short-term and long term improvement.</p>
        <p>While playing in the Sketch Book page, I got some good ideas for how
          to flesh out the drawing tools. First, the users said that it would be
          helpful to highlight whichever color and size are currently being
          used, so that they don't have to draw something in order to find out
          what is loaded onto the cursor. They also said that despited the
          erasor, they might like to have an undo and redo option. One user,
          Mara, also noticed that the frame of the canvas can be erased, so I
          made a not to move the frame outside of the Canvas area. These are all
          minor fixes that I can make to improve the functionality of the sketch
          book.</p>
        <p>I noticed that all three users chose to go to the sketch page first,
          instead of choosing to "view portfolios" from the home page. The
          buttons are identical besides the words inside them, so it seems that
          the prospect of making something is more exciting. While this is an
          encouraging instinct, I am now considering that the website should
          open to a page of portfolios as the home page. It would have a button
          to go to the sketch page, but would prevent users from bypassing
          exploring others' work. Though each user went to the sketch book
          first. Natalie, pictured below, is the only user who knew what what to
          draw. Natalie played with the sketch book, then looked at portfolios,
          and finally went back to the sketch book and drew a house. The other
          user only played with how the colors and sizes function. I think
          eliminating the option to skip viewing portfolios would prevent the
          hesitation that kids might feel when staring at a blank canvas. Doing
          this would take some work with reorganizing the way the site flows and
          the page set up and layout, but it is definitley something to consider
          as I move forward with the project.</p>
