        <p>The two most important concepts I want to work with are a goal of
          teaching and an audience of young students. After examining the
          <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/viddiverse-a-safe-online-video-network-exclusively-for-kids-premieres-this-week-258095071.html" target="_blank">viddiverse</a>
          and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>
          as developmental platforms aimed at students, many important issues
          have been brought to my attention.</p>
        <p>First, it occurred to me that it is important to ensure that a site
          for kids is safe and secure. viddiverse is a website that was put
          online in 2014, but no longer exists, perhaps because of security
          concerns. When signing up for an account on the site, a kid is
          prompted to enter their parent’s email, providing the parents with
          access to surveillance and account permissions. Though the
          advertisement for the site makes it seem thorough, nothing prevents a
          twelve-year-old from entering their own email account and setting
          their own permissions without the parents knowledge. Khan Academy, on
          the other hand, does not require parental permissions. The site
          doesn’t allow for content from users and is not intended for
          socializing (aside from comments and questions that are probably
          monitored), so there is little risk associated with stumbling across
          something inappropriate or someone suspicious. This means that it
          would be very important to find a balance of limiting the content that
          users can upload to the site and finding a way for parents to monitor
          their children.</p>

        <p>Second, it is very important to be able to appeal to a wide age range
          of kids. The general graphics on the viddiverse site made use of
          bright colors and animations to attract attention. It also seemed
          appealing because it aspired to be a social media platform reminiscent
          of YouTube and facebook, and so allowed younger kids to get involved
          with the similar sites to the ones they aspired to get involved with
          as teens. Thought the design of the Khan Academy website is more basic
          and simple, it encourages learning math by starting with a video and
          then continuing to an interactive quiz. Both sites have a way of
          inviting the user to participate instead of simply providing
          content.</p>
        <p>A third concern I have is usability. I think it is important to get
          kids interested in learning while they are young, presenting the
          problem that they may not be very familiar with computers. A website
          for kids age 5-13 would need to be very easy to navigate. The
          viddiverse website aimed to simplify video making down to button
          clicking. Though typing is an important skill, kids who are just
          learning to use computers may get frustrated if they are required to
          use the keys to use the site. Khan Academy also requires very little
          typing in the lessons aimed at younger children.</p>

          </figure>
        <p>Finally, another potential reason that the viddiverse site failed, I
          understand the risks of allowing children to create content for a
          webpage. Assuming the content that users upload is appropriate and
          educational, there is even still the concern that kids are completely
          inexperienced in teaching and could be incorrect, misleading, unclear,
          boring, etc. Khan Academy manages to teach effectively because the
          content is compiled by someone who has an idea of how to teach through
          an online media. My research on these two websites has given me some
          ideas, but also brought many concerns to my attention about dealing
          with user involvement on a website.</p>
