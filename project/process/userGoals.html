        <p>How will your users understand the content of the project?</p>
        <p>Because the Art of Collaboration app is meant for kids, it needs to
          cater to students of varying reading levels. It will be important that
          the navigation of the app relies heavily on visual language, and uses
          written lanuage as a back up.</p>
        <p>It will also be important not to overload the user with information.
          the app should only ask one question at a time and provide intructions
          in a short and concise manner.</p>

        <p>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</p>
        <p>The app will encourage students to find other students to work with
          and share ideas with. The point of the app is to get student connected
          to art and each other, so the app will show users what others are
          working on.</p>

        <p>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do
          they need it?</p>
        <p>The most important feature of the app will be that it can upload and
          download images. This will allow students to shared both finished
          works and works in progress. It will also need a form that will guide
          users in putting together a portfolio. Finally, the app will have have
          a sketch pad that will allow users to create art even without other
          resources.</p>

        <p>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and
          what are their experience levels with the type of media you are
          creating?</p>
        <p>The users' experience with digital media will vary greatly. The Art
          of Collaboration app should be a good first experience with computers
          and tablets. The user will be able to navigate the app easily through
          clear visual language. Tablet touch screens will make navigation more
          instinctual for younger users with less computer experience.</p>
